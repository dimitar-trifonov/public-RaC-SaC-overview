# Requirements-as-Code (RaC) / Systems-as-Code (SaC)

> **RaC is a framework that helps provide expected results, regardless of how they are achieved.**  
> Think of it like this: **RaC is a recipe that helps the LLM cook your app.**

---

## 🌐 What Is RaC/SaC?

**RaC (Requirements-as-Code)** encodes system logic in a **structured, declarative format** — turning intent into **testable, auditable specifications**.  

Instead of burying business rules inside prompts or code, RaC describes them transparently in YAML files (`state/`, `events/`, `logic/`, `tests/`).  

**SaC (Systems-as-Code)** extends this foundation to cover **roles, policies, and governance**, making RaC/SaC a general-purpose **language of systems**.

## ⚡ Why It Matters

Today’s AI development often struggles with:
- ❌ Fragile prompts  
- ❌ Hidden logic inside implementations  
- ❌ Lack of reproducibility  
- ❌ No clear audit trail  

RaC/SaC changes this by introducing:
- ✅ **Traceability** — logic is transparent, versioned, auditable  
- ✅ **Simulation-first** — requirements validated before coding  
- ✅ **Cross-role collaboration** — PMs, designers, and devs share one source of truth  
- ✅ **Framework-agnostic** — bind once, reuse logic across tech stacks  
- ✅ **Enterprise readiness** — governance and compliance built-in

## 🔄 Comparison: Current AI Dev vs RaC/SaC

| Aspect | Current AI Development (Prompt-Centric) | RaC/SaC Development (Structure-Centric) |
|--------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Requirements** | Freeform notes, PM docs → ambiguous | `.rac.yaml` specs for state, events, logic, tests |
| **Workflow Design** | Iterative prompt tuning, ad-hoc chaining | **Simulation-first** flows validated before code |
| **Logic Location** | Hidden in code or prompts | Transparent, testable RaC specs (LogicOps layer) |
| **Role Involvement** | Devs translate intent; PMs can’t verify | PMs, QA, designers, and devs share RaC folder |
| **Traceability** | Prompt drift, hard to reproduce | Deterministic, versioned, auditable |
| **Testing** | Manual QA, unpredictable | Structured `.rac.yaml` test cases in CLI simulation |
| **Governance** | Added later (compliance retrofits) | **Built-in**: audit, versioning, RBAC |
| **Output Consistency** | Results vary across runs/models | Durable specs, model-agnostic |
| **Developer Focus** | Glue code + debugging LLM quirks | Integrating bindings + extending specs |
| **Enterprise Value** | Fragile demos | Reliable, scalable, compliance-ready systems |

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Product managers seeking **AI-native frameworks**  
- Engineers tired of **fragile prompt spaghetti**  
- Teams needing **audit-ready systems**  
- Enterprises balancing **AI speed with compliance**

## ⚠️ Note on Patent Filing

This README provides a **public overview** of RaC/SaC.  
The full RaC Foundation white paper exists in private draft mode, as certain technical mechanisms are under **active patent filing**.  

➡️ Once the filing process is complete, additional details will be shared.  

---

## 📌 Summary

RaC/SaC isn’t about replacing developers.  
It’s about **separating logic from implementation**, making AI development **reliable, auditable, and cross-role friendly**.  

👉 Just as *Infrastructure-as-Code* professionalized cloud, **RaC/SaC will professionalize AI-native systems**.
