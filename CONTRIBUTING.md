# Contributing to RaC/SaC Public Overview

Thank you for your interest in **Requirements-as-Code (RaC)** and **Systems-as-Code (SaC)**.

At this stage, this repository serves as a **public overview and reference only**.  
Because certain technical mechanisms are under **active patent filing**, we are **not accepting direct contributions** (pull requests or code changes) at this time.

## How You Can Engage
- ‚≠ê Star the repository to follow updates.  
- üó®Ô∏è Share the public README for awareness and discussion.  
- üì¨ If you would like to discuss RaC/SaC concepts or potential collaborations, please reach out via LinkedIn or email.

## Future Contributions
Once the patent filing process is complete, we plan to open parts of the RaC ecosystem for community input and contribution.

Thank you for understanding and supporting this work during its early stages.
